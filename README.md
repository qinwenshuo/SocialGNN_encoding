# SocialGNN Encoding Results


## Figures Overview

The figures are stored in the `result_figures/behavioral_encoding` directory and represent the final states (the last 
hidden layer) of different models tested. 

Ridge regression: Ridge regression is performed using RidgeCV, which automatically selects the best regularization strength 
(alpha) from 10^(-5), 10^-4ï¼Œ 10^-3, 10^-2, 10^-1, 10. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on both a cross-validation set and the test set.
